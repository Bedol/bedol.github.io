Hello, and welcome to my blog!

My name is **Bartłomiej Weber**, and I'm passionate about DevOps and building and managing application environments. When it comes to programming, my main focus lies in web application development using the Ruby on Rails framework. Lately, I've also been delving into the intricacies of JavaScript and TypeScript.

I started my journey in 2015 as a Junior Ruby Developer at GetResponse. After two years, I was promoted to the role of Ruby Developer. At GetResponse, I was primarily involved in creating and maintaining payment processing applications, and later I focused on affiliate programs. In early 2023, I decided to venture out on my own, and I now provide Ruby programming services as part of my work with Prowly. Currently, I'm responsible for maintaining the PR reporting area and email message delivery.

I have a relaxed writing style, but I strive to explain topics thoroughly to ensure a clear understanding.

My goal with this blog is to share the knowledge I've acquired over the years and build my personal brand.

Outside the world of programming, I enjoy playing games, particularly simulators like truck driving or train conducting. I also have a passion for sports games such as FIFA. To clear my mind, I love hopping on my bike and going for long rides.

Feel free to reach out to me via email at bartlomiej.weber@gmail.com if you have any questions or would like to connect.

Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope you find the content valuable!

Best regards,

Bartłomiej Weber
